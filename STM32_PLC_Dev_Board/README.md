# STM32 PLC Board

The STM32 PLC Board is built around the STM32F732x microcontroller, serving as a programmable logic controller without the use of mechanical relays. Instead, it utilizes PC817 and MOC3021 optocouplers to emulate relay functionality, providing enhanced durability and faster, more reliable signal response.
